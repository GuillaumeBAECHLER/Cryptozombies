# CryptoZombies

This repository is nothing but the finished course of CryptoZombies. A way to find more easily some information while building my next DApps !

[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) is a good way to start learning Solidity and Web3.

> CryptoZombies is an interactive code school that teaches you to write smart contracts in Solidity through building your own crypto-collectables game.

Thanks to [Loom Network](https://loomx.io/), you can learn how to build a DApp based on the Ethereum blockchain.
